# ninechippers

Yet another emulator for the CHIP-8! Now in C!

## Run

To run, simply run `make` to create the `ninechipper` executable, and `./bin/ninechipper <filename>` to run!
I don't think this requires any dependencies at the moment.

## Known Issues

- If you pass a directory into command line args it somehow works. idk
